# Built out a web app to search different types of pokemon up to Gen 5. Able to search for certain pokemon or get a random pokemon. Ability to favorite pokemon as well.
# Peer Review: This website is absolutely beautiful! The use of high-quality PNGs along with animated sprites for the evolution tree is amazing and I din't even know was possible. Two things, however: the favorites list is functionally useless. It saves the name of the pokemon, but if you click on the name it doesn't load in that pokemon's data. And the other thing is that, specifically for Eevee, Sylvion is shown in her evolution tree despite being after gen 5. Other than that great work! Mobile and tablet are clean.
